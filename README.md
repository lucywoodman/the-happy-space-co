## Design

Inspired by offices and coworking spaces I've used, as well as online interior design photos, I came up with the following keywords for the brand:

 - Welcoming
 - Modern
 - Creative
 - Classy

### Colours

The site is designed using a modern, bright and clean palette (modern, creative), with a warm and elegant dark green (welcoming, classy) in the footer and text. This is to reflect how the venue would look, carrying the same feel from the website to the coworking space. New visitors would already have a positive emotional response from the design and expect the same from the venue.

![Palette](docs/design/palette.png)

### Fonts

The classy font "Playfair Display" is used for the headers, and the modern "Lato" is used for almost everything else. I chose to use "Abril Fatface" for any digits on the site, as this matches the header font well but doesn't drop below the baseline like Playfair does. This makes it easier to read and keeps the space around the pricing even.

### Imagery

All of the photos were selected as complimentary to the design, as well as showing workspaces that fit the brand keywords. The colours within the photos reflect the branding, using dark greens (plants), oranges/pinks (furniture, wood) and whites.

Simple and modern line illustrations are used for the main features of the coworking space, as a creative alternative to using further photos on the home page. The same simple line style is used for the logo and icons.

### Structure

The website uses a well-known and well-experienced web design pattern, to provide a comforting and predictable experience to users. With the logo in the top left, navigation in the top right. Each page has a large "hero " section displaying the page title and each section is highlighted with a shift in background colour.

The header and footer on each of the longer pages matches, allowing users to quickly find their way around. There's also a call-to-action above the footer to encourage users to get in touch or make a booking.

The one page the does not entirely match is the contact page. As the user would already be contacting the venue or making a booking at this point, the call to action isn't required. As the page is quite short, the contact details are moved up from the footer into a more visible location and the footer links are removed.

</details>

## Features

The page consists of 4 pages and 10 features.

### 1. Logo and Navigation

The logo and navigation are predictably at the top of every page. They're fully responsive, with the navigation menu switching to a "hamburger" on smaller screens. All pages are included, and the currently active page is highlighted.

![Logo and Navigation](docs/features/feature_logo-and-nav.png)

### 2. Hero section

The hero section welcomes visitors to the page with a headline, a description of what the company does and two call-to-action links for the primary business goals. The company is validated with social proof in the forms of a testimonial with user image, and a Trustpilot score.

The supporting images are inline with the overall brand. The main photo is looking back towards the headline to encourage visitors to return their focus to the left.

- User stories covered: 6, 9, 11, 15, 16.

![Hero](docs/features/feature_hero.png)

### 3. Services section

The services section highlights the two main types of workspaces (private or open) as well as two benefits (common areas and 24/7 access). Each has a line illustration and a short description.

- User stories covered: 1, 3, 4.

![Services](docs/features/feature_services.png)

### 4. Testimonial section

Two longer testimonials with supporting images, names and titles that act as additional social proof to reassure new visitors that the company offers an excellent service and experience. This ties into the primary business goal.

The images slightly overlap with the backgrounds of the previous and following sections, as a subtle nudge to encourage scrolling.

- User stories covered: 16.

![Testimonials](docs/features/feature_testimonials.png)

### 5. FAQ section

The FAQ section uses non-obtrusive `<details>` HTML tags to keep the lengthy answers hidden away unless required. Users can open up whichever question they'd like to know the answer for.

- User stories covered: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

![FAQ](docs/features/feature_faq.png)

### 6. Call to action

The main call to action section is at the bottom of 3 of the pages. The home page and gallery page encourage visitors to make a booking, while the pricing page encourages visitors to get in touch. All link to the contact page. This is another opportunity to fulfill the primary business goal.

- User stories covered: 9, 15.

![FAQ](docs/features/feature_cta.png)

### 7. Footer

The footer provides a secondary menu that mirrors the navigation at the top of the page, to allow visitors to quickly find the other pages. It also provides the business address, phone number, email address and social media links. Lastly, there's a copyright statement at the bottom.

- User stories covered: 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17.

![FAQ](docs/features/feature_footer.png)

### 8. Pricing page

The pricing page provides more detailed information on the different workspaces available and how much they cost. Each come with their own perks which are listed on each of the workspace cards. Every card has a call-to-action to encourage booking. 

At the bottom of this page, the main call-to-action has been tweaked to say "Not sure?" with a link to the saying "Contact us" instead of "Book a session". This is in the hope that if none of the price points suit the needs of the visitor, that they will contact the business instead.

- User stories covered: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17.

![Pricing](docs/features/feature_pricing.png)

### 9. Gallery page

The gallery page uses a masonry grid style to display photos of the venue. All images are selected in keeping with the overall brand. They are also styled to match the other images on the site, with curved corners and a subtle shadow.

- User stories covered: 1, 3, 4, 16.

![Gallery](docs/features/feature_gallery.png)

### 10. Contact page

The contact page contains a contact form on the left, and a Google map with contact details below on the right. The form has been styled in keeping with the brand, with lots of space to make it easy to use. It asks for a date and start/finish times for bookings, as well as using radio buttons for contact preference.

The map highlights the location of the venue within the town center. The contact details are the same as what is shown in the footer on the other pages, except brought higher up the page for better visibility. To avoid repeating content, the footer has been removed for this page (though the copyright remains).

- User stories covered: 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17.

## Bugs

| **Bug**         | **Fix** |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Bug explanation | Bug fix |
| Button hover states aren't working correctly | Move `.button` class from the `<li>` to the `<a>` element |
| Menu button looks ugly after adding mobile navigation | This is because the navigation relies on `display: block-inline`, which messes up the button styling. This could have been fixed with some CSS changes, but I opted to remove the button instead |
| Logo image sits above logo after adding mobile navigation | Move it to inside the logo's `<li>` element. |
| Logo breaks into two lines on smaller screens | Reduce the font size for smaller screens |
| FAQ items are not using the full width available | Remove width restriction from FAQ answer `<p>` elements |
| Pricing cards are not spaced correctly | Reduce padding on the cards and add a width of 33% |
| Pricing cards do not align at the top after adding responsiveness | Add `align-items: flex-start` to parent container |
| Map is not responsive | Remove width and height from the iframe and add extra CSS as per [this GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/magnetikonline/8487169) |
| Safari shows triangles for `<summary>` tag, even though it's hidden in the CSS | Set `summary::-webkit-details-marker` to `display: none;` |
| Mobile menu toggle causes accessibility checker to fail | Give the link an `aria-label` |
